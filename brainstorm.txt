Mid-Progress Report
-------------------

- [Done] Dataset (Me)
- Dataloader (Nishant)
- [Done] files to test our code (Me) 
- Neural Network architectures (Designing)
  - 128x128 
  - CNNs? nn?
  - RNN (Pratik)

- dataset
  - randomly generate start/goal states (valid)
  - start+current state (x,y) / goal state (x,y) / image map (128x128) / next_state (x,y)

  - epochs (each trajectory is an epoch), pair of consecutive states as the whole dataset
Due: Saturday Night

- Office hours
  - 2pm-3pm

Brainstormed Milestone Ideas:

- Dataset Generation (Me)
- Designing Neural Networks and posting initial architectures (post to Github for all)
  - one that takes in encoded maps as input
  - one that takes in the actual map as input
- Dataloader (Nishant)
- Explore Recurrent Neural Networks (Pratik?)
- Set up files to test neural networks / visualize paths (Any takers?)
- Autoencoders 
  - not strictly necessary but might be useful since they're used in the MPNet Paper?
