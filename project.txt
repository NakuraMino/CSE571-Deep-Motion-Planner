project content: 

use neural network to predict next action/path for robot

Meeting: Wednesday morning (11am)
- goal is to come up with milestones for mid-progress report

mid-progress (5/26): 
- data generation (map -> path)
  - autoencoder? (map -> encodes into only the important features)
- decide architecture for neural network
- recurrent neural network?

-----------------------------------------
Nishant discussion points for 20th May
-----------------------------------------

Points to discuss:
- Advice about the project given in guided hw pdf.
- Start without non-holonomic. Predict x_t+1 given x_t, map and goal. Use A* as supervisor.
- Is encoder necessary? How can decoder be created?
- Inputs from TAs regarding:
  - If encoder necessary, its output dimension?
  - Recommended map size?
  - NN structure? Feedforward?
  - If NN is to predict u_t instead of x_t+1, are the dynamics presumed to be known or separate network to learn dynamics? How about non-holonomic version?
- Neglect dynamic obstacles as mentioned in [7] for now. Mostly try to replicate [6]
- How to structure dataset

Possible mid-progress goals:
- Get A* working
- Generate trajectories (holonomic for now) in given maps with random init, goal positions using A*
- Create training and testing sets

Next steps:
- Decide on NN architecture
- Implement and train NN
- If results good, move on to robot with non-holonomic constraints
