# CSE571-Project-2

motion planning using neural network-based planning algorithms! 

To run our code, go to src/ and run 

> python run_astar.py -t -i -s -g 

> python run_rrt.py -t i -s -g

where
- t indicates whether to use test or training data (test or train, default=train)
- i indicated index of map we're using
- s is start state
- g is goal state
