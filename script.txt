In this project, we explore how deep learning can be used to imitate existing path planning techniques. Specifically, we consider
three neural network-based planning algorithms. We demonstrate the applications of these techiques on the point robot and the nonholonomic car, 
evaluate them on a variety of maps, and present our results.

For the holonomic dataset, we generate optimal paths from the A* planner. 

For the nonholonomic dataset, we use the RRT planner. We generate two types of paths: paths that have the highest cost after running the algorithm 
for 5 seconds, and paths where the start and goal states are identical except for the orientation. This allows the neural network to generate
motions where the robot has to change directions.

In general, we used this design for our networks. We pass in the map image through a few convolutional layers, and then pass in the resulting values, along 
with the start/goal states, through the remaining fully connected layers. We also include dropout layers and use them for training and predicting. 
Dropout layers are useful because their randomness can help us recover from failed predictions. If a network predicts an invalid action, 
we can pass in the same input to obtain different motions.
